# Hangman
A simple console based hangman game, intended to help beginners get a grasp for python.

The database (words.data) is empty except for the words foo and bar. To fill it just paste all words you want to use without spaces separated by a semicolon.

The normal version (hangman.py) only works on Python 3. Use the legacy version (hangman_legacy.py) for older versions of Python.
